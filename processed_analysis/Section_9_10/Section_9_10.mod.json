When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where\nthe Lean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n- Bare-bones API for the Mathlib versions of adherent at infinity, and limits at infinity.\n"]}
