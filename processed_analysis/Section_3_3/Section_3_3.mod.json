When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- A notion of function `Function X Y` between two sets `X`, `Y` in the set theory of Section 3.1\n- Various relations with the Mathlib notion of a function `X → Y` between two types `X`, `Y`.\n  (Note from Section 3.1 that every `Set` `X` can also be viewed as a subtype\n  `{x : Object // x ∈ X }` of `Object`.)\n- Basic function properties and operations, such as composition, one-to-one and onto functions,\n  and inverses.\n\nIn the rest of the book we will deprecate the Chapter 3 version of a function, and work with the\nMathlib notion of a function instead.  Even within this section, we will switch to the Mathlib\nformalism for some of the examples involving number systems such as `ℤ` or `ℝ` that have not been\nimplemented in the Chapter 3 framework.\n\nWe will work here with the version `Nat` of the natural numbers internal to the Chapter 3 set\ntheory, though usually we will use coercions to then immediately translate to the Mathlib\nnatural numbers `ℕ`.\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n\n"]}
