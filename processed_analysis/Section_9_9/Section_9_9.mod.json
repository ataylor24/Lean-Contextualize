When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where\nthe Lean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n- API for Mathlib's `UniformContinuousOn`.\n- Continuous functions on compact intervals are uniformly continuous.\n\n"]}
