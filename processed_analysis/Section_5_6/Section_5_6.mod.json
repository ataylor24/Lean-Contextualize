When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Exponentiating reals to natural numbers and integers.\n- nth roots.\n- Raising a real to a rational number.\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n\n"]}
