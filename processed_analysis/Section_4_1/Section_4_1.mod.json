When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Definition of the \"Section 4.1\" integers, `Section_4_1.Int`, as formal differences `a —— b` of\n  natural numbers `a b:ℕ`, up to equivalence.  (This is a quotient of a scaffolding type\n  `Section_4_1.PreInt`, which consists of formal differences without any equivalence imposed.)\n\n- ring operations and order these integers, as well as an embedding of ℕ.\n\n- Equivalence with the Mathlib integers `_root_.Int` (or `ℤ`), which we will use going forward.\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n\n"]}
