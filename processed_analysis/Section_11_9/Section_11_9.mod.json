When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a\nmore faithful translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will\nbe places where the Lean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I\nhave consciously avoided doing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n- The fundamental theorems of calculus.\n"]}
