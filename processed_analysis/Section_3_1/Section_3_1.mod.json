All numbering refers to\nthe original text.\n\nI have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original\ntext. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- A type `Chapter3.SetTheory.Set` of sets\n- A type `Chapter3.SetTheory.Object` of objects\n- An axiom that every set is (or can be coerced into) an object\n- The empty set `∅`, singletons `{y}`, and pairs `{y,z}` (and more general finite tuples), with\n  their attendant axioms\n- Pairwise union `X ∪ Y`, and their attendant axioms\n- Coercion of a set `A` to its associated type `A.toSubtype`, which is a subtype of `Object`, and\n  basic API.  (This is a technical construction needed to make the Zermelo-Frankel set theory\n  compatible with the dependent type theory of Lean.)\n- The specification `A.specify P` of a set `A` and a predicate `P: A.toSubtype → Prop` to the\n  subset of elements of `A` obeying `P`, and the axiom of specification.\n  TODO: somehow implement set builder elaboration for this.\n- The replacement `A.replace hP` of a set `A` via a predicate\n  `P: A.toSubtype → Object → Prop` obeying a uniqueness condition\n  `∀ x y y', P x y ∧ P x y' → y = y'`, and the axiom of replacement.\n- A bijective correspondence between the Mathlib natural numbers `ℕ` and a set\n  `Chapter3.Nat : Chapter3.Set` (the axiom of infinity).\n- Axioms of regularity, power set, and union (used in later sections of this chapter, but not\n  required here)\n- Connections with Mathlib's notion of a set\n\nThe other axioms of Zermelo-Frankel set theory are discussed in later sections.\n\nSome technical notes:\n- Mathlib of course has its own notion of a `Set` (or more precisely, a type `Set X` associated to\n  each type `X`), which is not compatible with the notion `Chapter3.Set` defined here,\n  though we will try to make the notations match as much as possible.  This causes some notational\n  conflict: for instance, one may need to explicitly specify `(∅:Chapter3.Set)` instead of just `∅`\n  to indicate that one is using the `Chapter3.Set` version of the empty set, rather than the\n  Mathlib version of the empty set, and similarly for other notation defined here.\n- In Analysis I, we chose to work with an \"impure\" set theory, in which there could be more\n  `Object`s than just `Set`s.  In the type theory of Lean, this requires treating `Chapter3.Set`\n  and `Chapter3.Object` as distinct types. Occasionally this means we have to use a coercion\n  `(X: Chapter3.Object)` of a `Chapter3.Set` `X` to make into a `Chapter3.Object`: this is\n  mostly needed when manipulating sets of sets.\n- Strictly speaking, a set `X:Set` is not a type; however, we will coerce sets to types, and\n  specifically to a subtype of `Object`.  A similar coercion is in place for Mathlib's\n  formalization of sets.\n- After this chapter is concluded, the notion of a `Chapter3.SetTheory.Set` will be deprecated in\n  favor of the standard Mathlib notion of a `Set` (or more precisely of the type `Set X` of a set\n  in a given type `X`).  However, due to various technical incompatibilities between set theory\n  and type theory, we will not attempt to create a full equivalence between these two\n  notions of sets. (As such, this makes this entire chapter optional from the point of view of\n  the rest of the book, though we retain it for pedagogical purposes.)\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n"]}
