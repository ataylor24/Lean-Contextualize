In particular, one should use the full Mathlib API for `ℕ` for\nall subsequent chapters, in lieu of the `Chapter2.Nat` API.\n\nFilling the sorries here requires both the Chapter2.Nat API and the Mathlib API for the standard\nnatural numbers `ℕ`.  As such, they are excellent exercises to prepare you for the aforementioned\ntransition.\n\nIn second half of this section we also give a fully axiomatic treatment of the natural numbers\nvia the Peano axioms. The treatment in the preceding three sections was only partially axiomatic,\nbecause we used a specific construction `Chapter2.Nat` of the natural numbers that was an inductive\ntype, and used that inductive type to construct a recursor.  Here, we give some exercises to show\nhow one can accomplish the same tasks directly from the Peano axioms, without knowing the specific\nimplementation of the natural numbers.\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n\n"]}
