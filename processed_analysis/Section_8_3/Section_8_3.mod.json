When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Uncountable sets.\n\nSome non-trivial API is provided beyond what is given in the textbook in order connect these\nnotions with existing summation notions.\n\n"]}
