When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Definition of the \"Section 4.2\" rationals, `Section_4_2.Rat`, as formal differences `a // b` of\n  integers `a b:ℤ`, up to equivalence.  (This is a quotient of a scaffolding type\n  `Section_4_2.PreRat`, which consists of formal differences without any equivalence imposed.)\n\n- Field operations and order on these rationals, as well as an embedding of ℕ and ℤ.\n\n- Equivalence with the Mathlib rationals `_root_.Rat` (or `ℚ`), which we will use going forward.\n\nNote: here (and in the sequel) we use Mathlib's natural numbers `ℕ` and integers `ℤ` rather than\nthe Chapter 2 natural numbers and Section 4.1 integers.\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n\n"]}
