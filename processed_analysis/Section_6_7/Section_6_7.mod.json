When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Real exponentiation.\n\nBecause the Chapter 5 reals have been deprecated in favor of the Mathlib reals, and Mathlib real\nexponentiation is defined without first going through rational exponentiation, we will adopt a\nsomewhat awkward compromise, in that we will initially accept the Mathlib exponentiation operation\n(with all its API) when the exponent is a rational, and use this to define a notion of real\nexponentiation which in the epilogue to this chapter we will show is identical to the Mathlib operation.\n"]}
