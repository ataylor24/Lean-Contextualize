When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful translation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the Lean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided doing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Equivalent characterizations of convergence of nonnegative series.\n- Cauchy condensation test.\n\n"]}
