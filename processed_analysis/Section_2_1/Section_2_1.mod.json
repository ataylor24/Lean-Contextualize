        "# Analysis I, Section 2.1: The Peano Axioms\n\nThis file is a translation of Section 2.1 of Analysis I to Lean 4.  All numbering refers to the\noriginal text.\n\nI have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original\ntext.  When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided doing\nso.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Definition of the \"Chapter 2\" natural numbers, `Chapter2.Nat`, abbreviated as `Nat` within the\n  Chapter2 namespace. (In the book, the natural numbers are treated in a purely axiomatic\n  fashion, as a type that obeys the Peano axioms; but here we take advantage of Lean's native\n  inductive types to explicitly construct a version of the natural numbers that obey those\n  axioms.  One could also proceed more axiomatically, as is done in Section 3 for set theory:\n  see the epilogue to this chapter.)\n- Establishment of the Peano axioms for `Chapter2.Nat`.\n- Recursive definitions for `Chapter2.Nat`.\n\nNote: at the end of this chapter, the `Chapter2.Nat` class will be deprecated in favor of the\nstandard Mathlib class `_root_.Nat`, or `ℕ`.  However, we will develop the properties of\n`Chapter2.Nat` \"by hand\" in the next few sections for pedagogical purposes.\n\n"
