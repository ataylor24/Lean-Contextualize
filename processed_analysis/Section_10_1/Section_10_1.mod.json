When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where\nthe Lean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n- API for Mathlib's `HasDerivWithinAt`, `derivWithin`, and `DifferentiableWithinAt`.\n\nNote that the Mathlib conventions differ slightly from that in the text, in that\ndifferentiability is defined even at points that are not limit points of the domain;\nderivatives in such cases may not be unique, but `derivWithin` still selects one such\nderivative in such cases (or `0`, if no derivative exists).\n\n"]}
