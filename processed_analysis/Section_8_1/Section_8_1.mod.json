{"imports":[["Init"],["Mathlib","Tactic"]],"docstring":["# Analysis I, Section 8.1: Countability\n\nI have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original\ntext. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Custom notions for \"equal cardinality\", \"countable\", and \"at most countable\".  Note that Mathlib's\n`Countable` typeclass corresponds to what we call \"at most countable\" in this text.\n- Countability of the integers and rationals.\n\nNote that as the Chapter 3 set theory has been deprecated, we will not re-use relevant constructions from that theory here, replacing them with Mathlib counterparts instead.\n\n"]}
