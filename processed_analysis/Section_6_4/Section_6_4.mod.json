When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Lim sup and lim inf of sequences\n- Limit points of sequences\n- Comparison and squeeze tests\n- Completeness of the reals\n\n"]}
