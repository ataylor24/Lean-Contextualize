When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Review of Mathlib's dependent product type `∀ α, X α`.\n- The axiom of choice in various equivalent forms, as well as the countable axiom of choice.\n\nAs the Chapter 3 set theory has been deprecated for many chapters at this point, we will not insert the axiom of choice directly into that theory in this text; but this could be accomplished if desired\n(e.g., by extending the `Chapter3.SetTheory` class to a `Chapter3.SetTheoryWithChoice` class), and\nstudents are welcome to attempt this separately.  Instead, we will use Mathlib's native\n`Classical.choice` axiom.  Technically, this axiom has already been used quite frequently in the\ntext already, in large part because Mathlib uses `Classical.choice` to derive many weaker statements,\nsuch as the law of the excluded middle.  So the distinctions made in the original text regarding\nwhether a given statement or not uses the axiom of choice are somewhat blurred in this formalization.\nIt is theoretically possible to restore this distinction by removing the reliance on Mathlib and\nworking throughout with custom structures such as `Chapter3.SetTheory` and\n`Chapter3.SetTheoryWithChoice`, but this would be extremely tedious and not attempted here.\n"]}
