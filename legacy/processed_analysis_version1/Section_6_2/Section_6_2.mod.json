When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Some API for Mathlib's extended reals `EReal`, particularly with regard to the supremum\n  operation `sSup` and infimum operation `sInf`.\n\n"]}
