When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Absolute convergence and summation on countably infinite or general sets.\n- Connections with Mathlib's `Summable` and `tsum`.\n- The Riemann rearrangement theorem.\n\nSome non-trivial API is provided beyond what is given in the textbook in order connect these\nnotions with existing summation notions.\n\nAfter this section, the summation notation developed here will be deprecated in favor of Mathlib's API for `Summable` and `tsum`.\n\n"]}
