{"imports":[["Init"],["Mathlib","Tactic"]],"docstring":["# Analysis I, Section 7.1: Finite series\n\nI have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original\ntext. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nTechnical note: it is convenient in Lean to extend finite sequences (usually by zero) to be\nfunctions on the entire integers.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n","- API for summation over finite sets (encoded using Mathlib's `Finset` type), using the\n  `Finset.sum` method and the `∑ n ∈ A, f n` notation.\n- Fubini's theorem for finite series\n\nWe do not attempt to replicate the full API for `Finset.sum` here, but in subsequent sections we\nshall make liberal use of this API.\n\n"]}
