When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Definition of $ε$-closeness, $ε$-steadiness, and their eventual counterparts.\n- Notion of a Cauchy sequence, convergent sequence, and bounded sequence of reals.\n\n"]}
