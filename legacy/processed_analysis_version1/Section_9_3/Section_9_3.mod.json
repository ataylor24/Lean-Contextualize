When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where\nthe Lean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Limits of continuous functions\n- Connection with Mathilb's filter convergence concepts\n- Limit laws for functions\n\nTechnical point: in the text, the functions `f` studied are defined only on subsets `X` of `ℝ`, and\nleft undefined elsewhere.  However, in Lean, this then creates some fiddly conversions when trying\nto restrict `f` to various subsets of `X` (which, technically, are not precisely subsets of `ℝ`,\nthough they can be coerced to such).  To avoid this issue we will deviate from the text by having\nour functions defined on all of `ℝ` (with the understanding that they are assigned \"junk\" values\noutside of the domain `X` of interest).\n"]}
