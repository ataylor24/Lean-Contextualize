When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Basic properties of absolute value and exponentiation on the rational numbers (here we use the\n  Mathlib rational numbers `ℚ` rather than the Section 4.2 rational numbers).\n\nNote: to avoid notational conflict, we are using the standard Mathlib definitions of absolute\nvalue and exponentiation.  As such, it is possible to solve several of the exercises here rather\neasily using the Mathlib API for these operations.  However, the spirit of the exercises is to\nsolve these instead using the API provided in this section, as well as more basic Mathlib API for\nthe rational numbers that does not reference either absolute value or exponentiation.\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n\n"]}
