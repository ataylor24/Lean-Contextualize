When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Review of `PartialOrder`, `LinearOrder`, and `WellFoundedLT`, with some API.\n- Strong induction.\n- Zorn's lemma.\n\n"]}
