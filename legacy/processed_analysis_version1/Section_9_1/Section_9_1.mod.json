When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where\nthe Lean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n\n- Review of Mathlib intervals.\n- Adherent points, limit points, isolated points.\n- Closed sets and closure.\n- The Heine-Borel theorem for the real line.\n\n"]}
