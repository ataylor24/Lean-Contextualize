When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful\ntranslation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the\nLean code could be \"golfed\" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided\ndoing so.\n\nMain constructions and results of this section:\n- Definition of α-length.\n- The piecewise constant Riemann-Stieltjes integral.\n- The full Riemann-Stieltjes integral.\n\nTechnical notes:\n- In Lean it is more convenient to make definitions such as α-length and the Riemann-Stieltjes\n  integral totally defined, thus assigning \"junk\" values to the cases where the definition is\n  not intended to be applied. For the definition of α-length, the definition is intended to be\n  applied in contexts where left and right limits exist, and the function is extended by\n  constants to the left and right of its intended domain of definition; for instance, if a\n  function `f` is defined on `Icc 0 1`, then it is intended that `f x = f 1` for all `x ≥ 1`\n  and `f x = f 0` for all `x ≤ 0`; in particular, at a right endpoint, the value of a function\n  is intended to agree with its right limit, and similarly for the left endpoint, although we\n  do not enforce this in our definition of α-length. (For functions defined on open intervals,\n  the extension is immaterial.)\n- The notion of α-length and piecewise constant Riemann-Stieltjes integral is intended for\n  situations where left and right limits exist, such as for monotone functions or continuous\n  functions, though technically they make sense without these hypotheses. The full Riemann-Stieltjes\n  integral is intended for functions that are of bounded variation, though we shall restrict\n  attention to the special case of monotone increasing functions for the most part.\n"]}
