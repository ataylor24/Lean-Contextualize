This we do by matching\nboth structures with Dedekind cuts of the (Mathlib) rational numbers `ℚ`.\n\nFrom this point onwards, `Chapter5.Real` will be deprecated, and we will use the standard real\nnumbers `ℝ` instead.  In particular, one should use the full Mathlib API for `ℝ` for all\nsubsequent chapters, in lieu of the `Chapter5.Real` API.\n\nFilling the sorries here requires both the Chapter5.Real API and the Mathlib API for the standard\nnatural numbers `ℝ`.  As such, they are excellent exercises to prepare you for the aforementioned\ntransition.\n\n## Tips from past users\n\nUsers of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.\n\n- (Add tip here)\n\n"]}
